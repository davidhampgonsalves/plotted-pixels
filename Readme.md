Plotted Pixels is a small cli written in go-lang for turning pixel art into vector based images that are easily plottable. Its aim is to maximize line lengths to avoid pen up / down motions. 

## Usage
Clone repo and then `go run main.go file.png`

## About

This was a small afternoon project to play around with some ideas I had to avoid the full complexity of the traveling sales man problem (which this task falls into if you want to generate optimal paths) and see what kind of results I could achieve with some fast snake like approaches. 

I continued working on general vector fills for pen plotters in my subsiquent (https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/restaline)[Restaline] project.
